Hi, I'm Hind, a Graduate Student in Development Practice at UC Berkeley. My academic and professional focus lies at the intersection of climate change, migration, and conflict, with a particular interest in how these dynamics impact vulnerable communities in the MENASA region.
I am dedicated to exploring actionable migration pathways for populations facing both environmental and humanitarian challenges. My research dives deep into policy solutions that foster resilience and sustainable development for these communities.
My journey is informed by a multidisciplinary background in international relations, history, and political economy, which enriches my understanding of the global systems shaping climate policy and human mobility.
