    <h2>1. Project 1 for CSS class</h2>
    <p> This page is dedicated to Project 1 for our Computational Social Science class. For this project, we learned the basics of creating a reproducible workflow using GitHub. We each created a reposittory called Computational Social Science Projects" and practiced common commands such as creating a folder, editing its contents, adding committing and pushing changes to the main repo. We then practiced cloning a shared repository, branching and merging. Finally we each practiced personal website setup - like this one! 
	This hands-on practical project is ideal for familiarizing ourselves with GitHub workflows.
