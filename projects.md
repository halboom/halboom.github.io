    <h1>My Projects</h1>

    <h2>1. GitHub Pages Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
        This project is focused on building a personal website using GitHub Pages. The website includes an introduction about myself, my academic journey, and my ongoing research work. It is designed to showcase my portfolio and share my insights on climate policy and migration research.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Climate-Induced Migration Research</h2>
    <p>
        This ongoing research explores the intersections of climate change, conflict, and migration in the MENASA region. The study is aimed at identifying potential migration pathways for communities affected by climate and humanitarian vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Policy Solutions for Resilience</h2>
    <p>
        I am working on policy research that focuses on developing strategies for resilient, sustainable development in the face of climate-induced migration. This includes working with frameworks like the IGAD and ECOWAS to help strengthen economic safety nets for at-risk communities.
